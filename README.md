I created this project during my time at Berkeley under the supervision of __Professor Aiden McLoughlin__ <br>
The data citation and full formal report is in __LinearModelingReport.pdf__ <br>
The qmd (Quarto document) used to generate all visuals as well as perform the analysis is in __LinearModelingCode.qmd__ <br>
The raw R script is in __LinearModelingRCode.R__ <br>
The output of the code, written to a pdf, is in __LinearModelingCodeOutput.pdf__ <br>
An EDA visualization I created for the project is located in __LinearModelingEDA.png__  <br>
