# Unraveling Socioeconomic Factors in the U.S. Cancer Incidence : A Linear Modeling Approach
I created this project during my time at Berkeley under the supervision of __Professor Aiden McLoughlin__ <br>
The data citation and full formal report is in __LinearModelingReport.pdf__ <br>
The code used to generate all visuals as well as perform the analysis is in __LinearModelingCode.qmd__ (Rstudio file) <br>
The output of the code, written to a pdf, is in __LinearModelingCodeOutput.pdf__ <br>
An EDA visualization I created for the project is located in __LinearModelingEDA.png__  <br>
